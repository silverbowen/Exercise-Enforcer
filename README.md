# Exercise-Enforcer

This is the first iteration of the first module of a lifestyle management program. The idea is to replicate a personal trainer/assistant via a digital timer and push reminders. The user sets the type of reminder and interval between reminders (in this case, the exercise and number of minutes between reps).

Q - Why start with exercises that involve "reps"?

A - Because I've found this sort of exercise (strength/body building) difficult to accomplish when chunked into a half-hour to hour long workout session. Alternatively, I find it easy to drop and do a set of pushups, without working up much of a sweat or otherwise interrupting my flow. Enabling an outside source to remind me (demand) to do this keeps me on track and helps me remove the primary obstacle (exercising takes up large blocks of time).

Near future features - convert to OO/class-based, implement portable timer (via threading?), add # reps and/or other choices, file- or other-based persistence and stat tracking.

Far future features wishlist includes study manager, social media manger, diet monitor, a GUI, multimedia reminders/motivations (video and audio).
